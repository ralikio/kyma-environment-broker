# Kyma Bindings

You can manage credentials for accessing a given service through a Broker API endpoint related to bindings. The Broker API endpoints include all subpaths of `v2/service_instances/<service_id>/service_bindings`. In the case of Kyma Environment Broker (KEB), the generated credentials are a kubeconfig for a managed Kyma cluster. To generate a kubeconfig for a given Kyma instance, send the following request to the Broker API:

```
PUT http://localhost:8080/oauth/v2/service_instances/{{instance_id}}/service_bindings/{{binding_id}}?accepts_incomplete=true&accepts_incomplete=true&service_id={{service_id}}&plan_id={{plan_id}}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Broker-API-Version: 2.14

{
  "service_id": "{{service_id}}",
  "plan_id": "{{plan_id}}"
  "parameters": {
  }
}
```

The Broker returns a kubeconfig file in the response body. The kubeconfig file contains the necessary information to access the managed Kyma cluster. By default, KEB uses [`shoots/adminkubeconfig`](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/docs/usage/shoot_access.md#shootsadminkubeconfig-subresource) subresources to generate a kubeconfig that uses certificates to authenticate its user. To customize the format of the returned kubeconfig, use the `parameters` field of the request body:

| Name | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **token_request** | `false` | If set to `true`, the Broker returns a kubeconfig with a JWT token used as a user authentication mechanism. The token is generated using Kubernetes TokenRequest attached to a ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and ClusterRoleBinding, all named `kyma-binding-{{binding_id}}`. Such an approach allows for easily modifying the permissions granted to the kubeconfig. |
